# Joining and Connecting

Throughout week 01 - 05 we have looked at lots of new things. However, you may be interested in lots of them togteher. **Week 06** will look at how we might join two or more of these things together.

You  will be given an introduction to some methods in doing this such as

- Connecting drawing to Motors
- Connecting ink to imagery or sound
- Connecting real time graphics to Projection Mapping

Then the rest of the session will be beginning to look your own interests, direction and exploration of the new materials you have experienced.
