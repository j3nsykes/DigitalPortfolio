# Imagined Spaces

**Week 03** will look at how we can use Projection Mapping to add texture and narratives to objects and spaces.

You will be introduced to an open source tool called [VPT](https://hcgilje.wordpress.com/vpt/)
to help you explore projection mapping as a creative material. We will spend time exploring building physical sculpture elements using prepared boxes, simple furniture and found objects.

The idea is to use these objects as bare projection surfaces so the projections add to the surface of the objects and highlight around the objects. We will spend the day investigating the relationship between the physical and the digital by being playful with lights, shadows, materials and other moving graphics techniques

You may want to take some still images from previous week's drawings or explore projecting video alongside stills. 

Areas of investigation for your consideration may include:
• the physical abstract three dimensional surface
• the relationship between the physical and the digital imagery
• play with lights, shadows and materials

### Structure:
