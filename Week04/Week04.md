# Making Things Move

**Week 04** will explore how we can bring physical objects to life. We will look in detail at different modes of kinetic movement with [Arduino](http://arduino.cc).

Via a visual, building block tool [Ardublockly](https://ardublockly.embeddedlog.com/demo/index.html) you will be introduced to the Arduino environment. Using various different motors you will explore the different types of movement you can generate with these.

### References:
These examples may give you an idea of what is possible with motors.
