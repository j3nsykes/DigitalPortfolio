# Conductive drawing

**Week 02** will take the digital drawings created last week and investigate how we can make these interactive by touch.

The recent development of [ink that can conduct electricity](https://www.bareconductive.com/make/5-things-you-can-do-with-your-electric-paint-50ml-jar/) opens up exciting possibilities for combining the visual, tangible and electronic. With the application of some ingenious software (P5 and Arduino!), a pad of ink can be made to behave like a capacitor, and thus used to sense the proximity of the human body.  

These technologies can be used together to quickly integrate the physical with the digital, bringing your drawings to life!

You will be given a kit to interface between a conductive ink pad and a computer running P5.

You will be shown how to get this kit setup and given an overview of the principles of operation. You will then be given a short introduction to  how to tweak your code from last week to explore human touch control over draw lines, rectangles, ellipses, and vary colour, transparency and line weights.

Your challenge is to expand last week's interactive drawing using primitive shapes in P5, and using a conductive ink pad as a sensor. The ink artwork should be developed in tandem with the drawing graphic so that there is a clear relationship between the two. Think about what processes can be applied to the ink, and what its limitations are.
