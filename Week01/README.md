# Digital Mark Making

**Week 01** of the Digital portfolio course is all about exploring mark making methods with digital materials. To do this we will look at [P5.js](https://p5js.org/).

P5 is an open source computer coding platform designed for, and very accessible to, artists and designers. Alongside side this is a website called Openprocessing.org where the online community can share and test each otherâ€™s code.

We will spend the day making comparisons and relationships between what can be done with paper and pencil and what can be done digitally with code.

- How might one differ from the other?
- What might be graphically interesting about digital mediums?
- How can code become a creative material?

A good source of reference is this article [Why Love Generative Art](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art?fbclid=IwAR0-aNBGnRNtk2n_s2gy_51b0nBj9RzFRrpnGQjUFRGvX5EojezUNJtDMPc) about the history of Generative Artwork tracing back from algorithmic artwork created by hand to that created by machine.  

### Exercise 01: The Canvas
Explore the P5 environment looking at the canvas and how we can draw on it.
- setup()
- draw()
- rect()

### Exercise 02: Animate
What methods can we use to animate our graphics?
- mouseX
- mouseY


### Exercise 03: Traces
How can we do the opposite of animating? What if we want to see traces of our drawings, similar to a pencil on paper?

- stroke()
- strokeWeight()
- background()

### Exercise 04: Colour and Form
How can we personalise these drawing methods?

- color()
- ellipse()
- line()
- random()
